# Unique-exponents
This repository contains my project for school subject Algorithms 2.

Expected input are two integers a_max and b_max with possible values 3-100 for each one of them. a_min = b_min = 2
a_min <= a <= a_max
b_min <= b <= b_max
The assignment was to return a single number which is calculated as number of unique numbers you receive when you calculate a to power of b for all posible combinations of a and b.

Code contains comments in czech language.
